# AWS Device Farm and Selenium WebDriver
Device Farm Desktop Browser &amp; Mobile Testing

AWS Device Farm is a testing service from AWS that can help us to improve the quality of our web and mobile applications by testing them across a wide range of desktop browsers and real mobile devices without the need to deploy and manage a test infrastructure. 

The service allows us to run our tests on multiple desktop browsers or real devices to speed up the execution of your test suite and generates videos and logs to help you quickly identify problems with your application.
